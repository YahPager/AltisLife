Hello,

I was seeing on websites asking if anyone one knew of us myself or Paronity,
because they wanted to use our Emergency Lighting System in their Arma 3 Mod.

I don't have any issue with people using this code on an Arma 3 Mod as long as
Myself (Pager) and Paronity get credit for it.

At the beginning when I made this code I had Paronity look over the code and 
give me pointers as to how to make it work better At the time I just started
doing code and Paronity was our Head Coder for our Arma Mods for GSN PC Gaming.

I have included all you will need to get this to work for Cop's ONLY. If you want 
it for Medic lights you will have to do it yourself, the code is there you have to
tweak it for your needs.

As far as this working I no longer have Arma 3 on my PC so I have no way to test it,
I haven't tweaked it that much, so it should. I don't guarantee it to work...
