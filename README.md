Hello,

I was seeing on websites asking if anyone one knew of us myself or Paronity,
because they wanted to use our Emergency Lighting System in their Arma 3 Mod.

I don't have any issue with people using this code on an Arma 3 Mod as long as
Myself (Pager) and Paronity get credit for it.

At the beginning when I made this code I had Paronity look over the code and 
give me pointers as to how to make it work better At the time I just started
doing code and Paronity was our Head Coder for our Arma Mods for GSN PC Gaming.
